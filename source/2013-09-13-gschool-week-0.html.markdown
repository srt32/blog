###1 week down, 23 to go.  

This week was the first week of [gSchool](http://gschool.it/ "gSchool") Ruby Cohort 1 (actually the second cohort, learn about [zero indexing](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Array.html)) and I'm excited to be part of a strong and diverse group of like-minded students.  My classmastes are artists, veterans, butter makers, hardware programmers, and all Denverites for at least the next 6 months.

I enrolled in gSchool with three main **learning goals**: 1) teamwork, 2) philosophy, and 3) frameworks.


**1. Teamwork**  
I've been teaching myself and hacking on Rails for about a year now.  I've done the majority of my coding as the only contributor.  My [GitHub page](http://github.com/srt32) is lonely most of the time.  I can tell from this first week that the majority of our work (if not all) will be done with a pair or a team.  I am excited to learn how to build software with others.


**2. Philosophy**  
Meetups, Google, and StackOverflow can get you only so far.  I can't count how many times I've had a specific problem and found dozens of different ways to go about solving it.  My pervailing philosophy has been to do what works and follow best practices (convention) whenever I know how to do so.  I look forward to being steeped in a coherent and thorough coding philosophy. 


**3. Frameworks**  
Teamwork and philosophy are all well and good but without specific skills on which to execute you get nowhere. I know how to write Ruby scripts and build Rails apps.  I'm now on the path to writing good scripts and bomb-proof apps.
 Ruby, Rails, and Javascript will be my canvas for the next 6 months.
