This week was a 'rest' week at gSchool where we worked on shorter and more open
ended projects.  My team made a tic tac toe [game](https://github.com/rrgayhart/Tic-Tac-Toe) in Ruby-Processing.  As we're between larger multi-week projects I had some more time to read and play around with some extra libraries.  I wrote a very simple [Shoes app](https://github.com/srt32/sales_engine_ui) on top of one of our last projects. 

My inspiration came form listening to [Zachary Scott](https://twitter.com/_zzak)
talk about Shoes at [RMR13](http://rockymtnruby.com/). I fired off a 'thank you'
tweet to Zach and got a quick response.  I'm still surprised at how friendly the
Ruby community can be and the more I learn the more I see that this behavior is
in the community dna
([MINSWAN-style](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-08-19-matz-is-nice-so-we-are-nice)).

Best of all, our conversation ended with the above tweet about how having fun is
what matters.  It's not every industry where that feeling is so prevalent.

Next week, we'll be jumping into our first [Sinatra
app](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/idea_box.html). I haven't touched Rails in the past 6 weeks as we've been focused on Ruby and my excitement is building about jumping  back into the HTTP world (this time with a much deeper understanding of the language).


####Some recommended reading from this week:

* The Regular Expression chapter from [Eloquent
  Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321584104)
* [A Tour Through Random
  Ruby](http://www.sitepoint.com/tour-random-ruby/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email)
* [Include vs. Extend in
  Ruby](http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/05/15/include-vs-extend-in-ruby/)
