Last Friday our gSchool class took a field trip to
[the Source](http://denver.eater.com/places/the-source) for our first code
retreat.  If you're not familiar with [code retreats](http://coderetreat.org/)
definitely check them out.  There are a ton listed on Meetup and there's one
happening in [Denver](http://www.meetup.com/Code-Retreat-Denver/) in December.

We were given two seemingly simple [problems](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/code_retreat) to work on, 99 Bottles of Beer and a moveable robot.

To make things more interesting though we worked under some constraints.  The
main constraint being that we had only 40 minutes to work on the problem with
a pair before we'd blow away our code and start again with a new pair.  In
addition to the speed dating style of coding we imposed some additional
limitations such as those below.

#### Some constraints
- Dumb keyboard
  - Where one person has hands on the keyboard and the other drives everything
    the typist does
- No talking
  - Anything goes; you just can't talk
- Ping pong pairing
  - The coders alternate typing line by line.  I write a line, you write a line,
    etc.
- No if statements
  - No if statements allowed.  Here's a [good
    primer](http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2013/04/23/the-death-of-ifs)
    on how to start thinking about this concept.

The most fun and productive session I had was where my pair and I combined no
talking with ping pong.  While awkward at first (picture all sorts of odd
gesticulation) and exhausting by the end we were forced to be extremely focused
and take our queues from our partner.

These retreats are a great way to work
with many different people in a short period of time, which opens you up to
different perspectives and ideas.  My main takeaway though from this code retreat
is that 'exercising' your code techniques is important for staying sharp and
a great way to learn some new and concepts.
