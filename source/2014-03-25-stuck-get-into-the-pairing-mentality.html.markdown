This post is on the softer side of things.  I was working on a Ruby
[exercism](http://exercism.io/) this morning alone in a coffeeshop and was just not getting anywhere.
The problem was simple enough:

```
Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals
```

However trivial the problem was I was just spinning my wheels.  It must have
been an off day.  I ended up with a mess of if statements that was seemingly
leading nowhere.  As I was about to stand up and get a coffee refill I found
myself thinking, "Man, I wish I could grab a pair to figure this thing out."
I really just wanted another mind and pair of eyes to bounce ideas off of.
I didn't have a pair though so I did the next best thing: find a related video
by Jim Weirich, RIP.  I dug up Jim's [Roman Numerals
Kata](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=983zk0eqYLY).

You could call it cheating to just go watch this video but I considered it
brainstorming and collaboration.  So, next time you're stuck and can't find
a human pair, create the virtual equivalent.
